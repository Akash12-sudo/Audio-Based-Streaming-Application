# Voice Streaming App

## Description
This is a voice streaming application that enables real-time speech-to-text conversion. It utilizes a Speech-to-Text (STT) API integrated into the `server.js` file for processing voice data. The app streams the text output to the front-end in real-time, allowing users to see the transcribed text instantly as they speak.

## Features
- Real-time speech-to-text conversion.
- Easy integration with different STT APIs.
- Lightweight front-end built with React.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Setup 

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>/backend

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

3. Set up your preferred Speech-to-Text API in the server.js file. Ensure that any necessary API keys or credentials are properly configured.

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start

### Usage
- Launch the app in your browser.
- Press the "Start Streaming" button to begin voice input.
- As you speak, the transcribed text will appear in real-time on the screen.
API Integration

## This app currently supports the integration of a Speech-to-Text API (you can replace this with your choice of service). For now, ensure that the API is set up in server.js.
